## Overview
The `stats-strided-dmeanvarpn` repository provides a robust solution for calculating the mean and variance of double-precision floating-point strided arrays. This library employs a two-pass algorithm to ensure accuracy and efficiency. It is designed for use in various statistical applications and can handle large datasets effectively.

### Key Features
- **Two-pass algorithm**: This approach minimizes rounding errors, providing accurate results.
- **Supports strided arrays**: Work seamlessly with arrays that have gaps between elements.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies for quick integration into projects.
- **Node.js compatibility**: Built for use with Node.js, making it easy to integrate into JavaScript applications.

## Installation
To install the package, use npm:

```bash
npm install stats-strided-dmeanvarpn
```

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and build it manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deadmen504/stats-strided-dmeanvarpn.git
cd stats-strided-dmeanvarpn
npm install
```

## Usage
To use the library, first import it into your JavaScript file:

```javascript
const { dmean, dvariance } = require('stats-strided-dmeanvarpn');
```

### Function Signatures
- **Mean**: `dmean(arr, stride, offset, length)`
- **Variance**: `dvariance(arr, stride, offset, length, biased)`

### Parameters
- `arr`: The input strided array.
- `stride`: The step size between elements.
- `offset`: The starting index in the array.
- `length`: The number of elements to consider.
- `biased`: A boolean to indicate whether to calculate biased variance (default is `false`).

### Example
Here is a simple example to demonstrate the usage:

```javascript
const { dmean, dvariance } = require('stats-strided-dmeanvarpn');

const arr = new Float64Array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]);
const stride = 1;
const offset = 0;
const length = arr.length;

const mean = dmean(arr, stride, offset, length);
const variance = dvariance(arr, stride, offset, length);

console.log(`Mean: ${mean}`); // Mean: 3
console.log(`Variance: ${variance}`); // Variance: 2
```

## API Reference
### `dmean(arr, stride, offset, length)`
Calculates the mean of the specified elements in the strided array.

### `dvariance(arr, stride, offset, length, biased)`
Calculates the variance of the specified elements in the strided array.

## Examples
### Example 1: Strided Array with Gaps
```javascript
const arr = new Float64Array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]);
const stride = 2; // Consider every second element
const offset = 0;
const length = 3; // Only the first three elements

const mean = dmean(arr, stride, offset, length);
const variance = dvariance(arr, stride, offset, length);

console.log(`Mean: ${mean}`); // Mean: 3
console.log(`Variance: ${variance}`); // Variance: 2
```

### Example 2: Biased Variance Calculation
```javascript
const arr = new Float64Array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]);
const stride = 1;
const offset = 0;
const length = arr.length;

const varianceBiased = dvariance(arr, stride, offset, length, true);
console.log(`Biased Variance: ${varianceBiased}`); // Biased Variance: 2
```

## Performance
The two-pass algorithm significantly enhances the performance for large datasets. It reduces the computational complexity while ensuring that the results remain accurate. The library is optimized for Node.js, taking advantage of its event-driven architecture.
